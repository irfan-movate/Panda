Diff between git pull, git fetch, git merge?

Git PULL: if you pull the file, then the file get pull from central repo to your local repo,
staging area and into working directory.
ex: git pull origin dev-branch

Git fetch: if you fetch the file, then the file get pull from central repo to your local repo. but it won't 
pull into staging area nor into working directory.
ex: git fetch or git fetch dev-branch
check status: git log origin/dev-branch

git Merge: Now if you want to get file from Local repo to working directory then need to use git merge.
ex: git merge origin/dev-branch

*********Git Pull = Git fetch + Git Merge********
*************************************************

Git status : To check status in staging area and working directory.
Git log: Use to check changes in Local repo
